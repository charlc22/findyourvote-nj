(10, 'LaMonica McIver', 'Democratic', 1, 2024, 
'The first Black woman to represent NJ-10 and the youngest ever to be elected to the United States House of Representatives from New Jersey, LaMonica McIver was sworn into Congress on September 23, 2024. She is a member of the House Small Business and Homeland Security Committees.
McIver has been shattering records in elected office since her start in public service. In 2018, she was elected as the youngest woman ever to the Newark City Council where she proudly served as council president for seven years. She was a stalwart champion for the needs and aspirations of every resident of Newark’s Central Ward, and now she’s bringing that same fight to the halls of Congress for all who live and work in the 10th Congressional District.
McIver ran for Congress because she knows far too many families are struggling to make ends meet, facing skyrocketing costs of food, housing, healthcare and education. She’s also seeing the devastating impact of climate change playing out throughout the district in the form of catastrophic flooding that threatens lives, homes and livelihoods. Too often, these challenges are treated as separate issues, but McIver knows they are deeply interconnected and require comprehensive solutions that she is committed to working on in Washington. 
McIver was born and raised in Newark’s Central Ward, where she still resides with her husband and daughter. As a proud product of Newark’s educational system, her passion for public service was ignited early by influential mentors like Mildred Crump, Ras Baraka and other local leaders.
Her journey into politics began at the age of 10, when she first mobilized other youth and highlighted the importance of civic engagement. Her early experiences, paired with her academic achievements—a degree in English Literature from Bloomfield College and a master’s degree in educational leadership and policy from Seton Hall University—set her on a path to merge education and public service in the pursuit of improving people''s lives.
Her leadership in the education sector, including her role as personnel director for Montclair Public Schools, underscores her commitment to institutional growth. From her start as a future business leader for Newark Public Schools to her work in key HR roles across multiple school districts, McIver has consistently demonstrated vision, adaptability and a true dedication to education. Most recently, she served as public affairs manager for PSE&G.
In 2012, McIver founded Newark G.A.L.S., Inc., a nonprofit devoted to nurturing future female leaders. Under her leadership, the organization has impacted over 3,000 young women through transformative programs, leaving a lasting imprint on the future of the city and the state.
As the youngest woman ever elected to the Newark Municipal Council and now to Congress from New Jersey, McIver is redefining what’s possible for future leaders. From her roots in Newark to her rise as a national thought leader, she stands as a symbol of empowerment, leadership and transformative change—and her journey is only just getting started.',

(10, 'Carmen Bucco', 'Republican', 0, 2024, 
'My name is Carmen Bucco a small business owner and founder of Bucco’s Rising Stars Foundation As a product of the foster care system, at times living on the streets. I had to overcome what a lot of foster children did growing up. I ran into a situation where I had to make a life altering decision either I would become a statistic or a part of society. With a help of some friends, I started to overcome many challenges that faced me.
I knew it would not be easy, but it has led me to where I am today. I knew it was important to have perseverance, discipline, and intense focus to be someone and build something I would be proud of. Now today I am so proud to say I am living the American dream while showing our young people that anything can happen if you work hard, follow your dreams and they create their own destiny.
I feel with my background, business mindset, the ability to negotiate and work with others no matter what the issue is and come together to find common ground and the attitude that failure should never be an option. I believe with these qualities I could be that candidate and help move our party in a forward direction.
I am running for office because there is a lot of work that needs to be done and I believe we can always do better for the public. There is always an uphill battle and must be able to work with others no matter the party. By doing this so much can be done to benefit all our communities.',
