(3, 'Steve Welzer', 'Green', 0, 2024, 
'Steven Welzer is no stranger to the fight for social justice, environmental sustainability, and grassroots activism. For over four decades, he has been at the forefront of movements that challenge the status quo, rooted in his deep conviction that a better world is not only possible but necessary.
It all began during his student days at Rutgers University, where he first developed a passion for economic justice and progressive reform. His commitment to activism remained steadfast as he earned a master’s degree in Economics in 1983, a foundation that would shape much of his later work. But it was not just in classrooms or lecture halls where Welzer found his voice. As a lifelong concerned New Jersey resident, he made a commitment to help “Green the Garden State” by working on electoral campaigns and activist initiatives that bridged the gap between theory and action.
Welzer’s professional life in tech support with the New Jersey Judiciary spanned over two decades, but it was his retirement in 2008 that marked a new chapter in his activism. He started to run for office on a regular basis, as a Green Party candidate for state assembly, for US House, and for governor in 2013. He gained influence as a writer of articles and essays with contributions to such publications as Green Pages and Z Magazine. He played key roles in organizing forums on cohousing and promoting the ecovillage movement. And as a decades-long editor of Green Horizon Magazine he developed a coterie of cutting-edge writers exploring issues at the intersection of politics, sustainability, and grassroots mobilization.
Welzer’s leadership within the Green Party of New Jersey speaks for itself. From his work on the Ralph Nader and Jill Stein presidential campaigns to his stewardship of various Green Party committees, he has demonstrated an unyielding commitment to building a political alternative that puts people and the planet first. His run for Congress in 2024 is the latest step in a career that has consistently pushed for a more equitable and sustainable future.
Today, as the Green Party’s candidate for the U.S. House of Representatives in New Jersey’s 3rd Congressional District, Steven Welzer is campaigning with the same energy and vision that has defined his activism for decades. His platform is a reflection of his lifetime of work: one that addresses climate change, social inequality, and the corporate stranglehold on American politics. He lives in East Windsor along with his supportive family crew: wife, Laura, daughter Nicole, and two granddaughters. And he remains committed to a New Jersey where the future is green, just, and grassroots-democratic.',
