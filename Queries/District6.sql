(6, 'Frank Pallone Jr.', 'Democratic', 1, 2024, 
'Frank Pallone, Jr. is serving his 18th full term in the U.S. House of Representatives. Pallone represents New Jersey''s 6th Congressional District, which covers most of Middlesex County, as well as the Bayshore and oceanfront areas of Monmouth County.
Throughout his career, Pallone has fought to make health care more affordable and accessible, protect and strengthen Medicare and Medicaid, and make the country''s food system safer. Pallone has also fought to protect New Jersey''s environment, including protecting our coast from dangerous offshore drilling, holding corporate polluters accountable for Superfund clean ups, and bolstering coastal resiliency. He is also a champion of the state''s commercial and recreational fishing industries.
Pallone is the top Democrat on the House Energy and Commerce Committee – the oldest continuous standing committee in the House that has one of the broadest jurisdictions of any congressional committee. The Committee''s jurisdiction includes, but is not limited to, issues pertaining to health care, energy, environment, commerce, food and drug safety, consumer protection, and communications and technology.
In 2010, as Chairman of the Subcommittee on Health, Pallone played a key role in authoring and passing the Affordable Care Act.
During the 117th Congress (2021-2022), as Chairman of the full Committee, Pallone was a leader in the fight to pass the Inflation Reduction Act—the most significant climate law in our nation''s history. The law will also lower prescription drug and health care costs for millions of Americans, while finally empowering Medicare to negotiate the cost of lifesaving prescription drugs for seniors, which Pallone has championed for years.
Pallone was also instrumental in the passage of the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law that has delivered federal funding to New Jersey to bolster the state''s electric vehicle infrastructure, invest in safe drinking water, and deploy affordable broadband. It also tackles dangerous PFAS chemicals and funds Superfund and brownfield cleanups. In addition, he also helped usher into law the CHIPS and Science Act to strengthen our economy and boost our domestic manufacturing industry.
In a federal spending bill for fiscal year 2023, Pallone fought for the inclusion of legislation that provides the Food and Drug Administration with the tools and resources it needs to oversee the cosmetics industry, which he first proposed over a decade ago. He also successfully pushed for provisions to provide continuous coverage for children and new mothers through Medicaid and the Children''s Health Insurance Program.
Pallone also continues to advocate for New Jersey, securing community projects in Middlesex and Monmouth County that will help rebuild infrastructure, promote public health, and bolster educational funding. He has also led efforts to successfully ban offshore drilling and ocean dumping to protect New Jersey’s coastline. He works constantly with the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers to complete multiple beach replacement projects at the Jersey Shore.
Pallone began his political career in Long Branch, where he was born and still resides. He was elected to the Long Branch City Council in 1982. In 1983, he was elected to the state Senate, representing the Monmouth County coastline. He was re-elected in 1987.
On November 8, 1988, Pallone was elected to the House of Representatives from New Jersey''s former Third District, which included parts of Monmouth and Ocean counties. After a new Congressional district map was adopted in 1992, Pallone was elected to represent the Sixth District that included large portions of Middlesex and Monmouth Counties in November of the same year.
Pallone''s Central Jersey district is an ethnically diverse area that includes New Brunswick, Asbury Park, and Perth Amboy. It includes Rutgers, the State University of New Jersey, and Monmouth University.
Pallone married his wife Sarah in 1992. They have three adult children, Rose, Celeste, and Frank.',

(6, 'Fahad Akhtar', 'COMMON SENSE INDEPENDENT', 0, 2024, 
'Fahad Akhtar was born and raised in central New Jersey. He has experience in community organizing, national security, financial services, government, and investment consulting. He is running for United States Congress in the Sixth District of New Jersey because as a wise man once said: "by refusing to participate in politics, you end up governed by your inferiors."
------
The son of an elementary school teacher and small business owner, Fahad was born in New Brunswick, New Jersey, and raised a few miles away. His childhood centered around martial arts, sports, and getting in trouble.
In high school, while flipping burgers three days a week at Burger King, Fahad dreamt of becoming a professional athlete. However, after realizing he was neither big nor talented enough to play in the NFL, he turned to government and politics as an outlet for his competitive spirit. Following a stint as president of his high school student government and student representative to the Board of Education, Fahad volunteered to spend the summer before his freshman year of college as one of the youngest organizing fellows for Organizing for Action, where he led local efforts to combat climate change. It was a fun summer, until Fahad''s father suffered a debilitating stroke. 
Fahad''s first few months at Rutgers University''s New Brunswick campus revolved around visiting his father in the hospital and earning as much as he could to help keep the lights on at home. But adversity makes men. Fahad excelled academically that year, became an economics tutor and teaching assistant, and rose to leadership positions in nearly every student activity in which he was involved. 
By his sophomore year, he was on his way to The White House as a presidential writer. After graduating college, Fahad joined BlackRock, where he worked in client businesses, portfolio construction, product development, and rose to become the firm''s youngest group manager. After four years at the pinnacle of public markets, he sold his Porsche, got married, and left BlackRock for Dartmouth''s Tuck School of Business. At the same time, he began managing his own private equity and venture investment firm. 
While at Dartmouth, Fahad served as a career advisor for the Next Step and Business Bridge Programs. It was through those programs that Fahad rekindled his desire to serve others, and decided to work his way back into government as a national security innovation fellow at the U.S. Department of Defense, where he spearheaded a China-related battlefield hardware initiative for Army SFG1 and PACOM. His time at DoD convinced Fahad that his desire to serve would be most valuable in the intelligence community. After studying up on the threats we faced, and writing America’s Future Wars: Russia, China, & Iran, Fahad headed to Quantico to become a Special Agent with the Federal Bureau of Investigation. 
Four months later, Fahad was assigned to the New York field office to defend our Nation''s critical infrastructure against intelligence and espionage threats from the People''s Republic of China. It was there that he realized that lawmakers have left our intelligence community at a severe disadvantage against our most sophisticated adversaries. That realization is what drove him to the decision to run for Congress. ahad is a practicing Muslim and father of two. He can shoot a perfect bullseye, runs a sub-6 minute mile, and benchpresses and squats more than all of the other candidates combined. 
He and his wife have visited nearly every National Park in the country by road, and he firmly believes that no one should be allowed to govern this country until they physically get to know it and love it.
