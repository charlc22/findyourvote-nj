(7, 'Thomas H. Kean Jr.', 'Republican', 1, 2024, 
'
Tom Kean, Jr. is serving his first term in Congress representing New Jersey’s 7th Congressional District. In the 118th Congress, Tom serves on the Transportation & Infrastructure Committee, the House Foreign Affairs Committee as Chair of the Europe Subcommittee, and the Science, Space, & Technology Committee. As the representative for more than 775,000 New Jersey residents, Tom is focused on keeping costs low for families, improving access to care, supporting a robust and reliable infrastructure, boosting innovation at home, and helping students reach their top potential.
Tom’s call to public service has been inspired by the proud heritage of the Kean family. The grandson of former U.S. Representative Robert Kean and son of former Governor Thomas H. Kean, Sr., Tom is continuing a legacy of dedicated public service to New Jersey.
Tom embarked on his career in public service when he received an appointment from President George H.W. Bush to work in the Environmental Protection Agency, where he met his wife, Rhonda. Following the Bush administration, Tom served as a legislative staffer in New Jersey Congressman Bob Franks’ Washington, D.C. office, where he advised the Congressman on commerce, energy resources, environmental issues, and foreign affairs. In addition to his professional duties in Washington, DC, he was the vice president of a fire department where he volunteered as a firefighter and an emergency medical technician.
In 2001, Tom was elected to the New Jersey General Assembly, where he quickly developed a reputation as a leader in bipartisan consensus. Two years later, Tom was named to the New Jersey Senate where he served 14 years as Republican Leader. In that time he led the caucus to pass property tax relief, invest in quality education for students, and fight for policies that create new jobs and economic opportunity.
In addition to serving as Leader, Tom also served on some of the most important Standing Legislative Committees including Budget & Appropriations, Commerce, Judiciary, Legislative Oversight, Higher Education, and Health & Human Services. His committee work enabled him to see firsthand how innovation could pave the way toward meaningful and common sense solutions on policy issues ranging from the economy to education to the environment.
The congressman also served as a senate liaison to several key state commissions including almost two decades on the State Council on the Arts. He was also the Senate appointee to the New Jersey Israel Commission and the New Jersey Amistad Commission.  
Tom’s work laid the groundwork for the creation of new industries, including a thriving Brewpub industry, and the transformation of existing ones by spearheading the State’s investment in technological advancement to spur economic development, job creation, and government efficiency.
Tom’s academic training and work experience reflect his lifelong concern for responsive and appropriate actions and policies that advance the preservation of the environment without imposing undue burdens on taxpayers and businesses.  As a legislator, he took a measured approach to supporting clean energy, recognizing that the State required a realistic, cost-effective way to create a renewable energy portfolio that embraced ALL available resources and emergent technologies, including nuclear, solar, and natural gas.  
His responsive, student-focused approach to education initiatives, such as expanding school choice, and as a strong defender of children and families earned him accolades as a healthcare “Champion for Children” and as a NJ Coalition Against Human Trafficking’s Legislative Champion. He was previously named Legislator of the Year by the Firefighters Mutual Benevolent Association, received the Legislative Leader Award from the New Jersey Conference of Mayors, and received a 100% voting rating from the National Federation of Independent Business.
Tom is a graduate of Dartmouth College and attended the Fletcher School of Law and Diplomacy at Tufts University. There, he received a master’s degree in law and diplomacy and was also employed as a graduate school instructor. Tom completed his doctoral studies ABD at Fletcher.
Tom, his wife Rhonda, and their two daughters reside in Westfield, New Jersey.',
