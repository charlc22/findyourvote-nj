(8, 'Rob Menendez', 'Democratic', 1, 2024, 
'Rob Menendez was born and raised in Hudson County and proudly serves New Jersey’s Eighth Congressional District in the House of Representatives. He is running for re-election to represent this diverse district and the common values that our communities share: respect and tolerance, hard work, New Jersey common sense, and the unshakeable idea that everyone should have the opportunity and tools to succeed.
Strengthening families is at the core of Rob’s purpose for serving our community. He understands the pressures and challenges families face in these difficult times. Rob is working in Congress to create solutions to those challenges – to make today better, and tomorrow a place where we can all thrive and reach our full potential.
Rob grew up valuing service that drives positive change in our communities. He was raised to believe in the importance of giving back and taking care of our neighbors. Today, Rob is raising his family in the shadow of the Statue of Liberty and continues to take to heart all she represents – the welcoming place where the American journey begins and the promise of America that works for everyone. These ideals guide Rob and they guide this campaign.
Rob was elected to the U.S. House of Representatives in 2022. He has focused his legislative priorities on uplifting working families, championing organized labor, prioritizing future-forward infrastructure, addressing climate change, protecting reproductive choice, and creating a high quality of life for all. Upon his arrival in Washington, Rob was elected by his peers to serve as Freshman Representative on the House Democrats’ Steering and Policy Committee, which works with House Democratic leadership to set policy priorities. Rob also was appointed to serve as Regional Whip for the House Democratic Caucus, a post in which he assists in advancing Democrats’ legislative priorities.
Since taking office, Rob has delivered more than $12 billion in federal dollars for New Jersey’s Eighth Congressional District – for transformative improvements to our transportation systems, protecting our environment, funding community projects, and much more. He is committed to finding comprehensive solutions for our toughest issues and serves as a voice for our shared priorities. 
Rob serves on the House Transportation and Infrastructure Committee, where he has advocated for greater access to mass transit for all 8th District residents via the development of the Gateway Program, the most important infrastructure project in the country, which recently received $6.9 billion from the U.S. Department of Transportation – the largest-ever mass transit grant in American history.
Rob is also a member of the Committee on Homeland Security, where he has focused on the cybersecurity challenges facing our country and has advocated for a humane and comprehensive approach to our immigration system and the challenges at our southern border. He has consistently fought Republicans’ hard-right narrative and advocated for the most vulnerable among us.
Rob is a member of several caucuses, ranging from the House Pro-Choice Caucus to the Dads’ Caucus, and is part of the largest Congressional Hispanic Caucus freshman class. His office has successfully completed more than 2,000 constituent cases for neighbors in our communities.
Before Congress, Rob served as a Commissioner of the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey, where he chaired the Governance and Ethics Committee and served as a member of the Finance Committee, which manages the Port Authority’s multi-billion-dollar annual budget.
Rob earned an undergraduate degree from the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill and a J.D. from Rutgers Law School. He and his wife, young daughter, and son live in the Lafayette neighborhood of Jersey City.',

'Anthony Valdes was born and raised in West New York, New Jersey. Anthony, like many of his peers, struggled growing up in a time when there was not a lot of opportunities for kids from his background. Starting work from a young age, Anthony understands the issues facing the people of District 8, because he lived the same experiences and knows first-hand what needs to be done to turn Main street around. Anthony grew up in the melting pot of North Hudson and is experienced with working as a community organizer with people of all different faiths and backgrounds, and charting a better path forward for West New York. Now working as a Multiple Dwelling Inspector for the NJ Department of Community Affairs, Anthony sees every day the real life issues facing our community. Together we can finally elect a Congressional Representative from the people, for the people.',
