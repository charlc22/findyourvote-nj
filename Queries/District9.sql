'Born and raised in Paterson, New Jersey, Nellie Pou’s parents came to the Garden State from Puerto Rico in 1953 to start their lives and raise a family.
Nellie’s father, Teodosio, was a blue collar worker for the City of Paterson, and her mother Dominga, was a homemaker and the rock of the family. Dominga always had something simmering on the stove and an extra seat at the table to warmly welcome family and friends any day of the week. While her parents worked hard to make ends meet, they instilled in Nellie and her four siblings a strong work ethic and commitment to their community and public service that guides her to this day.
Nellie attended Paterson public schools and later attended Kean University, before returning to Paterson where she began her career in public service. Nellie served in various roles for the City of Paterson, ranging from Director of Human Resources to Business Administrator. During her tenure in the City of Paterson, she made history in 1997 as the first Latina elected to represent the 35th Legislative District in the State Assembly, succeeding the late Congressman Bill Pascrell after he was elected to Congress. In 2012, she was elected to the State Senate, where she currently serves as the New Jersey Senate Majority Caucus Chair.
Throughout her career in public service, Nellie has been committed to improving the lives of New Jerseyans. From fighting for better schools for our kids to more affordable healthcare, to criminal justice reform– Nellie has been at the forefront of some of New Jersey’s toughest fights.
Now she is running for Congress to humbly and proudly succeed the late Congressman Pascrell, and continue fighting for New Jersey families. As a mother and grandmother, Nellie knows what New Jersey families are facing and will continue to work to create good paying jobs and bring down costs. From housing to groceries, Nellie understands that families are being squeezed by corporate greed driving up costs and she is ready to take that fight head on in Congress. Nellie will also continue to stand up to defend a woman’s right to make her own medical decisions, not just here in New Jersey, but across the country.
Nellie has dedicated her entire life to the community that raised her, and in Congress she will do the same.
Nellie is married to Richard Freid, a retired State Superior Court Judge from the Passaic County Vicinage. She is a proud mother of two children, Edwin II and Taina Pou and has four beautiful grandchildren.',

'I’m a mycologist, writer, and political activist running for Congress in New Jersey’s 9th Congressional District as a Green Party candidate. I graduated from Rutgers University, New Brunswick, in 2021 with a degree in Political Science. Growing up during the Financial Crisis of 2008 taught me many valuable lessons about the horrors of unchecked capitalism. Unfortunately, the American political system does not currently provide space for vocal opponents of big business. For far too long, the two-party system has failed American workers, with disastrous consequences for regular people.
That’s why I decided to run for Congress in 2024. You deserve to have another option on this year’s ballot: someone who will represent you and your community, fostering a genuine, human understanding of your needs. With the Green Party NJ, I’m fighting against the two-party system and demanding sustained rights for workers, women, communities of color, LGBTQ+ communities, and the environment.
I believe that the “change” so many of us were promised since the early 2000s will not be gifted to us by the ruling class. We, the working people of New Jersey, must stand up and demand these changes. Right now, the richest people in the country are accumulating more wealth than ever before, destroying our environment, our infrastructure, and our futures. Meanwhile, the number of people living paycheck-to-paycheck has ballooned out of control. This needs to change.
As a candidate from the Green Party NJ, I promise to never take corporate donations. Money has no place in the democratic process. Real, face-to-face human conversation is necessary for a democracy to function.
Our struggles are one struggle!
Eco-socialism for the working class and the indigenous peoples of the world! The movement cannot be silenced, and we cannot be stopped.',

'My name is Billy Prempeh, and my story is the American Dream. Born to Ghanaian immigrants who came to the United States legally over a span of 20 years—one of them waiting nearly 17 years to lawfully enter this country—I grew up in Paterson, New Jersey, where I saw firsthand the challenges families face while trying to build a better life. My parents sacrificed everything to give me the opportunities that only America can offer, and I vowed to make the most of their hard work by standing up for this country and everything it stands for.
At the age of 18, I made a decision that would shape my life. While my friends were enjoying their college experiences, I enlisted in the United States Air Force, swearing an oath to defend this country and the Constitution against all enemies, foreign and domestic. I was stationed in England at RAF Mildenhall, working as an aerospace ground equipment journeyman, ensuring that the machinery keeping our planes in the air was ready for any mission. It was during this time that my love for America deepened, and I began identifying with conservative values, grounded in hard work, patriotism, and putting America first.
But after serving my country abroad, I came home and saw a different kind of battle: the fight to restore opportunities to families like mine, struggling to keep up with an out-of-touch political class. In 2020, despite a pandemic, lockdowns, and minimal resources, I took on the challenge of running for Congress in New Jersey’s 9th District. With just hard work, faith, and grassroots support, I earned more votes than any Republican candidate had seen in 30 years in my district, securing 31% of the vote in my first run. By 2022, that number jumped to 44%. I achieved this without the luxury of big donors or the establishment backing, proving that this district is hungry for new leadership.
I’m running for Congress because I believe the people of the 9th District deserve a voice in Washington that reflects their needs and values—not the interests of career politicians. My opponent, Bill Pascrell, who was 87 years old, passed away in August 2024, and has since been replaced by a hand-selected puppet of the Democratic Party—a career politician more interested in preserving the status quo than serving the people. This is not the future the 9th District deserves, and I am here to offer a real alternative: fresh, bold leadership rooted in the principles of freedom, opportunity, and accountability.
Now more than ever, our chances of winning this race have never been stronger. Over the years, we’ve built a grassroots army that believes in this vision for America—one where government gets out of the way, and people are free to pursue their dreams. We’ve gained momentum with every election cycle, growing our support base and outpacing expectations. This time, we’re ready to cross the finish line and secure a victory for the 9th District.
I’ve lived the struggles many in our district face. I understand what it’s like to fight for every opportunity, and I’m here to fight for you. My policies are clear and focused on making life better for American families.
With your help, I will go to Washington to fight for the values that made this country great and ensure they continue to guide us into the future.
This is our time. The momentum is on our side, the establishment is scrambling, and together, we can bring real change to the 9th District. The odds are in our favor, but we need every voter, every supporter, to make this a reality. Will you join me in this fight? Let’s finish the work we’ve started and make the 9th District a beacon of freedom and opportunity for all.',
